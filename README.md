# Discord Bot For friends's server

Small fun project written with discord.js for a friend.  
Purpose of the bot is to iterate over all members of the server and assign roles based on their length of stay with server.

For ease of usage, roles are hardcoded as a module, instead of using database (this can be easily moved to sqlite or even in memory db which is provisioned after every start)

## Commands and usage

To start development mode:

```javascript
npm run dev
```

To start the app

```javascript
npm run start
```
